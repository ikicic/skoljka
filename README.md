# Installation (Docker)

Note: docker-based installation is work in progress.
The docker files are not optimal nor secure for production.

The containers and the repository worktree are organized as follows:
- No shared volumes are used, thus the container contains the copies of source and other files (because of performance issues of shared volumes in Docker on certain systems).
- Instead, when developing, use `./docker/docker_rsync.sh` to continuously synchronize source files from the worktree to the container. Avoid editing source files directly in the container, because they will be overwritten by this script.
- This includes `./skoljka/settings/local.py`. Thus, if you want to have two different containers (two different instances of skoljka image), create another git worktree.
- The `local/` folder (media and other files) are stored only in the container.
- This Docker setup should be considered a dev image, not a production or deploy image. Concretely, any changes to the JavaScript or SCSS files requires running the build script from within the container.

To set up the container, first build the image and start the container:
```sh
./docker/docker_build.sh skoljka-image-name
./docker/docker_mount.sh skoljka-image-name skoljka-container-name
```

From outside the container, run the following to prepare the worktree (i.e. `local.py`) and start synchronizing the container with the worktree:
```sh
./docker/setup_external.sh
./docker/docker_rsync.sh skoljka-container-name
```

In another terminal, open a terminal in the container:
```sh
docker exec -it skoljka-container-name /bin/bash
```
(If this command looks stuck, press enter to see the interactive shell.)

Within the container, run the following:
```sh
cd /app
./docker/setup_internal.sh
```

To run skoljka, run
```sh
cd /app
python2 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```
The webserver is accessible at http://localhost:8000/ .

To stop running the container, run:
```
docker stop skoljka-container-name
```

To resume the container, run:
```sh
# Outside the container.
docker start skoljka-container-name

# Within the container.
service mysql start                  # Sometimes fails on the first try.
mysqlcheck --repair --all-databases  # Sometimes needed.
```


# Development environment setup

```sh
# Install outside of the Python environment, to get the newest version.
python3 -m pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```


# Installation

This procedure is based on the following tutorial:
http://michal.karzynski.pl/blog/2013/06/09/django-nginx-gunicorn-virtualenv-supervisor/

NOTE: Consider using Docker installation above.
The following installation procedure might be broken.

1. Go to your projects folder (e.g. `~/projects`). Create and go to a virtual environment:
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install gettext git python2.7-dev python-virtualenv
  virtualenv -p `which python2` skoljka
  cd skoljka
  echo -e "export PYTHONPATH=\$PWD:\$PWD/skoljka:\$PYTHONPATH\nexport PROD=true\n\nsource bin/activate" > profile
  source profile
  ```

2. Clone skoljka and run the installation script:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/ikicic/skoljka.git
  cd skoljka
  scripts/install_dependencies.sh
  scripts/setup.sh
  ```

3. Create an empty `UTF8` database (use your **username**):
  ```sh
  mysql -e "CREATE DATABASE skoljka CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;" -u username -p
  ```

4. Fill out `settings/local.py`, at least the fields marked as `REQUIRED`.

5. Initialize database and build:
  ```sh
  python2 manage.py syncdb --noinput
  python2 manage.py loaddata folders userprofiles
  python2 build.py
  ```
  You can now use Django test server by running `python2 manage.py runserver`.
  The database is pre-filled with superuser `arhiva` whose password is `a`.
  Note that in `settings/local.py` the variable `DEBUG` is `False` by default, so static files won't be loaded correctly.


# Configuring gunicorn

The following three sections are used only for running in the release mode.

You should now be in `~/projects/skoljka/skoljka/`.

1. Run `cd ..` to move to `~/projects/skoljka/`.

2. Create file `runserver.sh`. (fill out **user** and **group** variables)
  ```sh
  #!/bin/bash
  set -e

  PORT=8079       # Internal port for non-static files
  LOGFILE=logs/skoljka.log
  NUM_WORKERS=3

  # user/group to run as
  USER=""
  GROUP=""

  source profile

  exec gunicorn skoljka.wsgi:application -w $NUM_WORKERS \
    --user=$USER --group=$GROUP --log-level=debug \
    --log-file=$LOGFILE -b localhost:$PORT
  ```

3. Set up `gunicorn`.
  ```sh
  chmod +x runserver.sh
  mkdir -p logs
  pip install gunicorn
  ```


# Configuring supervisor

1. Run the following commands:
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install supervisor
  touch logs/gunicorn_supervisor.log
  ```

2. Create file `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/skoljka.conf` (use `sudo`, and change these paths)
  ```
  [program:skoljka]
  directory = /home/username/projects/skoljka/
  command = /home/username/projects/skoljka/runserver.sh
  user = username
  stdout_logfile = /home/username/projects/skoljka/logs/gunicorn_supervisor.log
  stderr_logfile = /home/username/projects/skoljka/logs/gunicorn_supervisor.log
  ```

3. Run `skoljka` Django webserver:
  ```sh
  sudo supervisorctl reread
  sudo supervisorctl update
  sudo supervisorctl restart skoljka
  ```

# Configuring nginx

4. Install and start `nginx`:
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install nginx
  sudo service nginx start
  ```

5. Create `/etc/nginx/sites-available/skoljka` and the symlink `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/skoljka` to the first file. Use e.g. `8080` as the main port and remember to redirect `/` to the port `8079`. Look at the tutorial for the details.

6. Restart `nginx`
  ```sh
  sudo service nginx restart
  ```


# Testing

## Unit tests

The syntax to restrict which tests are executed:
```sh
python2 manage.py test --noinput competition.ChainSortingTest.test_custom_ordering
```

## End to end tests (E2E)

To run the E2E tests, first launch the test server in the Docker container:
```sh
python2 manage.py testserver --noinput --traceback --addrport=0.0.0.0:8000 skoljka/userprofile/fixtures/test_userprofiles.json skoljka/folder/fixtures/test_folders.json
```

Then, run the tests:
```sh
npx cypress run
```

Or, launch the GUI with:
```sh
npx cypress open
```
